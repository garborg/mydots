# remapping info:
#  man 7 xkeyboard-config

# For the either of the following remapping commands,
#   .profile, .xsession, & .xinitrc are all too early in the startup process
#   and are overwritten later (under gnome/ubuntu, at least)
#   adding user-level @reboot cron (via crontab -e [-u user]) also didn't work
# /usr/bin/setxkbmap -option 'caps:ctrl_modifier'
# /usr/bin/setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps
# now: install dconf-editor and http://askubuntu.com/a/365701
# or: `dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options "['ctrl:nocaps']"`
#  
# remaining alternative:
#   systemd, per-user
#   xmodmap: https://askubuntu.com/questions/363346/how-to-permanently-switch-caps-lock-and-esc
#   https://github.com/oblitum/caps2esc

# This mapping works, but is not enough for me without one of the preceeding mappings
# Didn't work in .xinitrc, .xsession. Didn't try .xprofile.
# Also didn't try the above setxkbmap command here
# Mapping both 'modifiers' right now. This runs before gnome keymappings take effect.
# /usr/bin/xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape;Control_L=Escape' -t 100
# /usr/bin/xcape -e 'Control_L=Escape' -t 100
/usr/bin/xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape;Control_L=Escape' -t 100
